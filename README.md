### Prerequisites

A LTS version of NodeJS is required, and it is recommended to use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) over npm.

### Installation

To install the dependencies run

```bash
yarn install

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Running Tests

How to run tests on your local system.

## Deployment

### Local

The application can be served using the built-in vite webs server. 

```bash
yarn dev
```
Watch the console for the port number that is serving the content.

### Production

The run the production code locally, first build the minified files.

```bash
yarn build
```
This creates a `dist` folder containing all the production files. This can be served locally with a simple web server or be uploaded somewhere to be made public. There are GitHub workflows included for deploying the application using GitHub pages.

## Usage

Any links to production environment, video demos and screenshots.

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial Research  
- [x] Minimum viable product  
- [ ] Alpha Release  
- [ ] Feature-Complete Release  

## Contributing

### Main Branch
Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. Should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch
Should be considered fragile, code should compile and run but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches
A branch per feature being worked on.
